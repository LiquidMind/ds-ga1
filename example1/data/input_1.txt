This assignment is intended to get you started with the course: to solve this assignment you will need to figure out how to create virtual machines and allow them to communicate to each other. The logic of the program itself is simple:
Write client and server applications. Every message sent by a client should be echoed to all connected clients. Applications shoud interact with each other - it can be plain communication via sockets, RPC or RMI. You are not allowed to use any existing implementations of RPC/RMI - you have to build them on your own.
The project is intentionally open-ended and there are many possible solutions.
You're free to pick any language of your choice.
We expect you to use Digital Ocean virtual machines or Docker containers. You'll have to submit:
•        source code
•        information on how to access to your virtual machines (for Digital Ocean)/ names of Docker images
•        documentation how to launch your system.
Good luck!

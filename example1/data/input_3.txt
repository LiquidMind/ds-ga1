Innopolis University Distributed Systems Summer 2015
Individual Assignment#3:
Urysov and Kovtunenko Leader Election Due: Thu Jun 26, 2015
Project description
This project asks you to implement shared document editor by using one of consensus algorithm on your choice:
? Raft
? Paxos
To simplify the assignment and get rid of UI part, the document can be replaced by single text line.
Implementation requirements
? You have to use distributed system of master nodes (at least 5)
? Your implementation should contain two major parts:
o First part corresponds to selection of a leader
o The second part consist of an broadcast shared data string initiated by the leader
? Implementation should satisfy to consensus algorithm requirements. For example for Paxos implementation system should be able to tolerate loss of not more than half of servers
Leader nodes requirements
? The chosen leader (among those 5 master nodes) should select the right value according to selected algorithm or update current value if such request was received from the slave node
? Leader should send all information about connected clients to other servers
? Minority of master nodes should add randomly generated delay for communication with other master nodes, which should guarantee different values at least on some master nodes
? Leader should write the log file
? After leader election, it should broadcast his address to all clients
Client’s requirements
? Each client should be able to read and write data string from the leading server
? Each client should write the log file
Additional requirements (extra points will be assigned)
? The system should be robust. It should be able to continue operation even if one of the participant nodes crashes, and it should be able to recover the state of a node following a crash so that it can resume operation.
Deliverables
? Source code
? Short report with explanation of the algorithm you chose, assumptions you made and other important aspects of implementation
